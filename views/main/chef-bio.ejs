    Manuel Romero, Executive Chef at Olea<br><br>

    Born in Spain, Chef Manuel Romero was raised in a family that loved 
    cooking traditional and tasty food. When he was a child, his family 
    moved to the United States, and he developed a passion for cooking by 
    watching, helping, and learning alongside his mother. He attended New 
    York Technical College in Brooklyn, New York, where he studied 
    hospitality management with a focus on the culinary arts. Building upon 
    his training and honing his craft, Chef Romero has worked in New York 
    with Chef Luis Bollo of Meigas and at the Hyatt Hotel, as well as at 
    Meson Galicia in Connecticut. He has also spent time training in Spain.<br><br>

    In 2001, he joined Caf√© Pika Tapas as a Sous Chef. One year later, the 
    restaurant expanded its culinary focus beyond tapas and changed its 
    name to Ibiza (which then became a highly-acclaimed Spanish 
    restaurant). He moved up the culinary ladder and, years later, was 
    appointed Executive Chef. His vision to create an atmosphere where his 
    team enjoyed their work while improving their culinary knowledge and 
    always thinking about the customer was realized.<br><br>

    In late summer of 2014, Chef Romero opened Olea restaurant in New 
    Haven, Connecticut, offering guests his innovative interpretation of 
    Spanish and Mediterranean cuisine. As the executive chef and co-
    owner, he is continually striving to build upon his vision of providing 
    exemplary dishes and a comprehensive guest experience, while also 
    encouraging a rewarding team environment for his staff.
